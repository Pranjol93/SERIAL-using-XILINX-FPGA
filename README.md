Title: Design and Implementation of a Programmable Serial IP Core with Linux Device Drivers

This project involves the end-to-end design and implementation of a programmable Serial IP module capable of UART communication. The module interfaces with a processor subsystem using the AXI4-lite protocol and supports robust features such as configurable baud rates, word sizes, and parity options. The design integrates hardware and software components to provide a versatile communication solution.

Key Features:
Hardware Design:

UART Communication:
Supports TX/RX data transfer without hardware handshaking.
Configurable baud rates from 75 to 250,000.
Data word sizes ranging from 5 to 8 bits.
Optional parity modes: off, even, odd, and custom.
Support for 1 or 2 stop bits.
FIFO Buffers:
Separate TX and RX FIFOs with 9-bit width and 16-depth.
Status indicators for full, empty, and overflow conditions.
Clock Management:
A programmable baud rate divider generates a data recovery clock.
Test clock output routed for external analysis.
Error Handling:
Detection and reporting of frame and parity errors with status registers.
Interrupt Support:
Hardware interrupt for efficient read/write operations.
Software Development:

Linux Kernel Module:
Enables control of the Serial IP core through sysfs files under /sys/class/uart/.
Configurable parameters include baud rate, word size, and parity mode.
Data read/write operations using tx_data and rx_data sysfs files.
Virtual Memory Control:
